# smartcon-reactive-nft
This is a reactive NFT that uses Chainlink keepers to update data on a cooldown!

You can literally copy-paste the contract and deploy via [Remix!](https://remix.ethereum.org)

Otherwise, you can deploy using whatever system you'd like, but you might have to import the contract via OpenZeppelin's NPM package.

Also, check out Austin's forkable, more complete, awesome app-ready Scaffold-ETH version [here!](https://github.com/austintgriffith/scaffold-eth/tree/keeper-nft)
